# Cardiovascular-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Analysis-for-Individuals-Under-the-Age-of-35
This project investigates how lifestyle choices among individuals under 35 can impact Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk. Using CDC's 2021 dataset, the analysis aims to predict and raise awareness about CVD risks, employing statistical and machine learning approaches to suggest early preventive measures for this age group.

Project background and purpose: The primal goal of this project is to raise awareness of CVD of young people and eventually improve their health. This goal would be achieved via multiple ways of efforts including analyzing diet habits and lifestyle that are relevant to CVD, discovering probabilities of having CVD among different demographic groups, building machine learning models to help predict the probability of having CVD in the future and what should be cautious about if already having CVD. In general all these efforts would be helpful to prevent having CVD and improve the general health status.

Motivation: With the growing unhealthy lifestyle decisions among our generation, we got interested in evaluating how different lifestyle choices can directly affect Cardiovascular Diseases among our peers. Chapter 7 of the book “The Analytics Edge” played a significant role in sparking our interest in this important topic as well. “Prevention is better than cure” hence through this analysis we can see what factors can lead to CVDs and control those variables early on in order to stay clear of CVDs.

Dataset: The Dataset comprises 308854 records with 19 variables, including General_Health, Checkup, Exercise, Heart_Disease, Skin_Cancer, Other_Cancer, Depression, Diabetes, Arthritis, Sex, Age_Category, Height_(cm), Weight_(kg),BMI, Smoking_History, Alcohol_Consumption, Fruit_Consumption, Green_Vegetables_Comsumption, FriedPotato_Consumption. There are 7 numerical variables and 12 categorical variables.

Methodology: In our dataset analysis, we took a comprehensive approach that blended descriptive, since we will be using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and graphs like scatter plots or bar charts, and inferential statistics, since we will be making inferences or drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. Initially, we delved into data exploration, primarily utilizing summary statistics to grasp the distribution of variables. Following this, we employed data visualization techniques to uncover correlations and patterns within the dataset. To identify these patterns, we utilized a correlation matrix, highlighting which parameters exhibited the strongest correlation with CVD. However, it's essential to remember that correlation doesn't necessarily imply causation. This means that while our analysis revealed correlations, establishing causation would require further modeling and controlled studies. Additionally, it's worth noting that our dataset is heavily skewed toward individuals without CVD, with a ratio of nearly 99/1. This skewness presents challenges in determining the true validity of our findings.

Data Source: For our analysis, we used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the year 2021. The BRFSS is well-known for providing reliable and comprehensive health-related data, making it a great choice for our research. You can access the original data source through this link:

The original dataset was quite extensive, with over 300 columns, and it was formatted for SAS using XPT and ASCII formats. However, we decided to work with a simpler version of the dataset, which was trimmed down to just 19 columns by a Kaggle user named Alphiree. We made this adjustment due to limitations in our ability to clean and process data that was not in CSV format. You can find the data we used at this link:

The dataset is sourced from the CDC and is part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for the year 2021. It comprises 308,854 rows and 19 columns, with each row corresponding to a data entry. The target value of interest is "Heart_Disease," which indicates whether a respondent has ever reported having heart disease.
